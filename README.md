Killer Queen Summoner

Killer Queen is a ten-player arcade cabinet game that lives at Kickstarter HQ. 

This is my Arduino code for the Killer Queen Summoner, a button that tweets out an alert from @ksr_killerqueen for Kickstarter employees to come downstairs and play Killer Queen. 

More details are posted on Kickstarter's engineering blog, Backing & Hacking.
